1.1 Background

Have you ever noticed how music has this amazing ability to match and uplift your mood? That's exactly what got us thinking about Moodify. In today's world, where we're constantly juggling between different emotions and situations, finding the right music can be like finding a friend who just gets you.

The thing is, most music apps out there just look at what you've listened to before or what's trending. But we thought, "What if your music player could actually understand how you're feeling right now?" That's where Moodify comes in – it's like having a DJ who can read your emotions and know exactly what you need to hear.

1.2 Problem Statement

Let's face it – scrolling through endless playlists when you're feeling down, or trying to find the perfect pump-up song when you're hitting the gym can be frustrating. Current music platforms might know what you like, but they don't know how you feel. Plus, our emotions change throughout the day, and manually finding the right music for each mood is time-consuming and often hits or misses.

The real challenge we're tackling is bridging that gap between human emotions and music selection. We want to create something that doesn't just play songs but actually understands and responds to your emotional state.

1.3 Objectives

Here's what we set out to achieve with Moodify:

• Create a system that can accurately detect your emotions through both facial expressions and text input
• Build a smart recommendation engine that understands the relationship between emotions and musical elements
• Develop a user-friendly interface that makes the whole experience smooth and natural
• Integrate with Spotify to access a vast library of songs and create personalized playlists
• Ensure the system works in real-time and adapts as your mood changes
