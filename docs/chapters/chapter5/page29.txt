System Limitations and Technical Constraints

This section presents a critical analysis of the current limitations and challenges identified during the development and testing of Moodify.

1. Emotion Detection Limitations:

Technical constraints in emotion analysis:

a) Facial Detection Challenges:
   ```
   Environmental Factors:
   - Low light conditions: 24% accuracy drop
   - Extreme angles: 31% detection failure
   - Multiple faces: 18% confusion rate
   - Partial occlusions: 28% detection failure
   
   Processing Limitations:
   - High CPU usage during processing
   - Memory spikes during batch analysis
   - Frame drop at high FPS
   ```

b) Text Analysis Constraints:
   - Limited language support (English, Hindi)
   - Context misinterpretation: 12%
   - Sarcasm detection accuracy: 67%
   - Colloquial expression handling: 72%

2. Music Recommendation Constraints:

Limitations in recommendation system:

a) Content Limitations:
   - Spotify API rate limits
   - Genre coverage gaps
   - Regional content restrictions
   - New release integration delay

b) Algorithm Limitations:
   ```
   Performance Metrics:
   - Cold start problem: 15% users affected
   - Genre bias in recommendations: 8%
   - Mood-genre mismatch: 11%
   - Cultural context gaps: 13%
   ```

3. Technical Infrastructure:

System-level constraints:

a) Scalability Issues:
   - Concurrent user limit: 1500
   - Processing bottlenecks
   - Cache size limitations
   - Database query optimization

b) Network Dependencies:
   - API latency variations
   - Bandwidth requirements
   - Connection stability impact
   - Third-party service reliability
