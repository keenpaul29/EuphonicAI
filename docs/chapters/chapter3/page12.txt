Frontend Architecture Implementation

This section details the frontend architecture of Moodify, focusing on the implementation of user interface components and client-side processing capabilities.

1. Next.js Framework Implementation:

The frontend utilizes Next.js 15 for enhanced performance:

a) Core Features:
   - Server-side rendering optimization
   - Static site generation capabilities
   - Dynamic routing implementation
   - API route integration
   - Image optimization

b) Performance Optimizations:
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Cache management
   - Bundle optimization
   - Resource prefetching

2. Component Architecture:

Key components implemented in the frontend:

a) Emotion Detection Interface:
   Implementation in Webcam.tsx:
   - WebRTC camera initialization
   - Frame capture processing
   - Real-time emotion detection
   - Confidence score display
   - Privacy controls

b) Text Analysis Component:
   Implementation in TextInput.tsx:
   - Natural language input
   - Real-time sentiment analysis
   - Multi-language support
   - Context preservation
   - Error handling

3. State Management:

Robust state management implementation:

a) React Hooks Implementation:
   - useState for local state
   - useEffect for side effects
   - useContext for global state
   - useCallback for optimization
   - useMemo for computation caching

b) Data Flow Management:
   - Unidirectional data flow
   - Props drilling prevention
   - Context API utilization
   - State immutability
   - Performance optimization
