Database Architecture and Data Management

This section outlines the database architecture implemented in Moodify, detailing the data models, relationships, and optimization strategies.

1. Database Schema Design:

Implementation of core data models:

a) User Data Structure:
   - Profile Information: Demographics, preferences
   - Authentication Data: OAuth tokens
   - Emotion History: Temporal emotion records
   - Music Preferences: Genre affinities
   - Playlist History: Generated recommendations

b) Music Data Organization:
   - Track Metadata: Audio features, genres
   - Emotion Mappings: Mood-music correlations
   - Playlist Records: Generated playlists
   - User Interactions: Feedback, ratings
   - Feature Vectors: Audio characteristics

2. Data Storage Implementation:

Multi-tier storage architecture:

a) Primary Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL):
   Implementation in schemas.py:
   - User Management: Profile data
   - Session Handling: Authentication
   - Playlist Management: User playlists
   - Emotion Records: Detection history
   - System Metrics: Performance data

b) Cache Layer (Redis):
   - Session Data: Active user sessions
   - Emotion Results: Recent detections
   - API Responses: Frequent requests
   - Token Cache: OAuth credentials
   - Feature Cache: Computed features

3. Data Access Patterns:

Optimized data retrieval strategies:

a) Query Optimization:
   - Indexed Access: Key fields
   - Query Caching: Frequent patterns
   - Connection Pooling: Resource management
   - Transaction Management: ACID compliance
   - Performance Monitoring: Query metrics

b) Data Security:
   - Encryption: Sensitive data
   - Access Control: Role-based
   - Data Validation: Input sanitization
   - Audit Logging: Access tracking
   - Backup Strategy: Regular snapshots
